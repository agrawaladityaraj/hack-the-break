# Project Buddy

Welcome to Project Buddy, a web application designed to help users kickstart their personal coding projects and add them to their resume. This repository contains the source code for Project Buddy.

## Inspiration

We were inspired to create Project Buddy after realizing the challenges of creating new projects for your resume and job searching. We wanted to create a platform that would be easy to use, accessible, and provide users with the necessary resources to achieve their goals. We also wanted to make the process fun and humorous to help those who are anxious when looking for work.

## What it does

Our web application offers a collaborative platform that connects users with a dedicated "project buddy" who provides guidance and support throughout the project planning phase. Additionally, our virtual assistant, Hoppa, prompts users to complete a series of interactive steps to ensure they're on track towards realizing their coding project. By the end of the planning process, users will have a comprehensive outline of their project, which they can begin to work on.

## How we built it

- Figma for design and prototyping
- Next.js for front-end development
- Supabase for the database
- MUI and Mantine for UI components
- Video cameras for filming
- Google Drive and Google Docs for file sharing and collaboration
- Discord for team communication
- We started by brainstorming and designing the platform in Figma. From there, we used React.js and Next.js to develop the front-end of the platform and integrated MUI and Mantine for UI components.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the biggest challenges we faced was time management, as we only had a limited amount of time to develop the platform. Additionally, integrating different tools and skillsets proved to be challenging, but we were able to overcome these obstacles through effective communication and collaboration.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

As a team, we're thrilled with what we've accomplished through this hackathon. Here are a few of our proudest achievements:

Creating an intuitive and visually appealing user interface: We've worked hard to design a user interface that's not only user-friendly but also unique and engaging.

Crafting a compelling project pitch: By creating a storyboard, editing, and framing the shots, we were able to produce a final pitch that effectively communicates the benefits and features of our web application.

Delivering a fully functional web app: One of our biggest accomplishments is that we've delivered a fully functional web application. Unlike our experience in previous hackathons where we didn't have a viable product to present, this time we were able to create a working app that can help users start their personal coding projects.

## What we learned

Throughout the development of our web application, we learned a lot about what it takes to create a user-friendly and effective platform that helps users kickstart their personal coding projects. Ultimately, we learned the importance of collaboration and splitting up tasks that match our strengths. By working together and allocating tasks to the right people, we learned to make a working web application and a project pitch we can be proud of.

## What's next for Project-Buddy

Overall, we are proud of what we were able to accomplish with Project Buddy, and believe that our platform has the potential to make a positive impact on individuals' project work for building their resume. We hope to add more animations and fun text to various other job-seeking challenges that people face. We would like users to have more experience with Hoppa in challenges such as interview practice and resume writing.

We are grateful for the opportunity to participate in Hack the Break and develop Project Buddy using a range of innovative tools and resources. Thank you for taking the time to check out our project!
